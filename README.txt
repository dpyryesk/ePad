ePad  is a computerized touch-screen tool for art therapists. The tool allows therapists to design individualized computer applications for particular clients. The resulting applications look like painting programs, but are usually simpler, can follow the therapeutic goals of the therapist designer, and can be adapted to particular user's needs, taking into account visual, auditory and motor capabilities. The tool also contains an artificially intelligent program that assists the art therapist in the task of keeping the user engaged.
